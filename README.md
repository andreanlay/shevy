# Shevy - Hand Drawn Shape Recognition
Shevy is an Android app created using Kotlin & Tensorflow Lite as the backend deep learning framework. I made this mini project as a way to practice MVVM build pattern and as a intro to Android Development using kotlin.

The Deep Learning model was trained using some Google's [Quick, Draw!](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset) datasets by downloading some of the relevant data (circles, squares, stars images, etc..) and converting the numpy bitmaps to trainable images. Detailed training process can be accessed in [This](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EMqU17Jttg_Zf2aOGhddFFPk0DgIsBOs?usp=sharing) colab
